\description{
Kaiser (1970) introduced a Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA), later modified
by Kaiser and Rice (1974). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic, which can
vary from 0 to 1, indicates the degree to which each variable in a set is
predicted without error by the other variables.
}
\details{
A value of 0 indicates that the sum of partial correlations is large relative
to the sum correlations, indicating factor analysis is likely to be
inappropriate. A KMO value close to 1 indicates that the sum of partial
correlations is not large relative to the sum of correlations and so factor
analysis should yield distinct and reliable factors.

Kaiser (1974) suggested that KMO > .9 were marvelous, in the .80s,
meritorious, in the .70s, middling, in the .60s, mediocre, in the .50s,
miserable, and less than .5, unacceptable. Hair et al. (2006) suggest
accepting a value > 0.5. Values between 0.5 and 0.7 are mediocre, and values
between 0.7 and 0.8 are good.

This function is strongly inspired by the \code{KMO} function in the
\strong{psych} package (Revelle, 2016). All credits goes to its author.
