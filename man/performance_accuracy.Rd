\title{Accuracy of predictions from model fit}
\usage{
performance_accuracy(model, method = c("cv", "boot"), k = 5, n = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Fitted model object of class \code{lm} or \code{glm}, the latter
being a logistic regression model (binary response).}

\item{method}{Character string, indicating whether crossvalidation
(\code{method = "cv"}) or bootstrapping (\code{method = "boot"})
is used to compute the accuracy values.}

\item{k}{The number of folds for the kfold-crossvalidation.}

\item{n}{Number of bootstrap-samples.}
}
\value{
A list with three values: The \code{Accuracy} of the model predictions, i.e.
   the proportion of accurately predicted values from the model, its standard
   error, \code{SE}, and the \code{Method} used to compute the accuracy.
}
\description{
This function calculates the predictive accuracy of linear
   or logistic regression models.
}
\details{
For linar models, the accuracy is the correlation coefficient
   between the actual and the predicted value of the outcome. For
   logistic regression models, the accuracy corresponds to the
   AUC-value, calculated with the \code{\link[bayestestR]{auc}}-function.
   \cr \cr
   The accuracy is the mean value of multiple correlation resp.
   AUC-values, which are either computed with crossvalidation
   or nonparametric bootstrapping (see argument \code{method}).
   The standard error is the standard deviation of the computed
   correlation resp. AUC-values.

model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars)
