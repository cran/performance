\title{Mean Square Error of Linear Models}
\usage{
performance_mse(model, verbose = TRUE)

mse(model, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle off warnings.}
}
\value{
Numeric, the mean square error of \code{model}.
}
\description{
Compute mean square error of linear models.
}
\details{
The mean square error is the mean of the sum of squared residuals,
  i.e. it measures the average of the squares of the errors. Less technicaly
  speaking, the mean square error can be considered as the variance of the
  residuals, i.e. the variation in the outcome the model doesn't explain.
  Lower values (closer to zero) indicate better fit.

data(mtcars)
m <- lm(mpg ~ hp + gear, data = mtcars)
